# Enara Health coding challenge â€¢ The letters game ðŸ”¥

## Notes:

- Made with expo for a quick setup using typescript option
- Just added a gradient library because apparently rn doesn't support it ðŸ˜®
- My code is in the src folder and a few imports in the app.tsx file, but 99% is in the src folder. 


## Instructions

- Install android studio to use its emulator or have a phone nearby

- You have to install the expo cli if you don't have it:
  - With npm `npm install -g expo-cli`
  - With yarn `yarn global add expo-cli`

- Clone the project
- Cd into the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- With the phone connected or with an emulator created in android studio run `yarn android`
  - [Follow these instruction to add an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
- It should start the expo app and open the app (my app)
- Enjoy(?) ðŸ˜…
